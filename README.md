## Adaptive Learning Platform (ALP) SDK v1.1.2 Quick Start Guide
***
API version 1.1.2

## Overview
***
This library enables the integration between ALP and your iOS app.

## Requirements

- This version of the SDK is designed for iOS 6 and above.
- The sdk provides ARC support. (To use the SDK in a non-ARC project, please use the -fobjc-arc compiler flag on all the files in the Kidaptive SDK.)

## Terminology

In order to understand some of the terms used in the sdk, please read the concepts below.

##### Learner
A child who plays our games/interacts with our appisodes/consumes our content.
    
##### Learner Model
A client-side framework containing a representation of a learnerâ€™s achievements/progress in learning dimensions.
    
##### Learner ability estimates   
These are quantified estimates of a learner's proficiency at a particular skill. These estimates are adjusted as new information from relevant game play and other relevant sources enter the ALP system. These estimates also  have standard deviations to indicate how confident the system is in the estimate.
    
##### Dimension
Dimensions represent the key skills and abilities that make up Kidaptive's early learning framework.
    
##### Category
Categories represent the structured evidence that is generated when learners play learning games. Categories contain Subcategories which contain Instances (described below). This hierarchy enables games to express various relationships between elements in the game interaction (information about context) and kinds of data that will be reported as evidence of learner judgments and decisions, i.e., evidence of learner understanding. Categories can also be thought of as the aggregate of elements in a game, e.g., the category "Shape" might be used to contain a set of Instances such as "triangle", "circle", and "octagon."
    
##### Prompt
Prompts represent the smallest reportable block of activity. In many cases, this will be a learner response to a single "question." This response, then, contains the evidence (the categories and instances, or "values") of what the learner did as well as information about the context in which those actions took place. 

##### Instances
Instances represent the most specific/discrete aspect of an element in a game that a Learner could interact with and that could be reported as evidence of Learner understanding in response to some challenge. For example, an instance for the category "Color" might be "Red." 

##### Items
Items represent the smallest unit of measurement for a given Dimension or skill. Items are mapped to Prompts, from simple cases where a Prompt contains data for evaluating a single Item, to more complex cases where a single Prompt contains multiple pieces of data which can be used to evaluate multiple items. Data in Prompt responses are mapped to Items and evaluated, turning the Prompt response into one or more Item Attempts.
    
##### Item Attempts
Item attempts are the evaluated outcomes of learner interactions. They are typically binary, successful or not, although they can represent other types of outcomes. Because Items are linked to particular skills (Dimensions), Item attempts are also linked to particular skills. Item attempts are the inputs to scoring processes like IRT analysis.

##### Level
A difficulty level is a configuration of Difficulty Factors that generates a set of Challenges that are comparable in difficulty.

##### Client IRT Control
Often learners are given multiple chances to solve a given puzzle or otherwise respond to a single challenge, but the second or subsequent response shouldn't be scored and analyzed in the IRT process in the same way as the initial attempt. Consequently, games can and should indicate when a particular Prompt response should or shouldn't be used to contribute to a Learner ability estimate by appropriately setting the SKIP_ITEM_IRT/SKIP_LEARNER_IRT flags according to whether the Learner's response is an initial or subsequent effort on a given challenge.  
    
## Getting Started

This document covers getting set up with the Kidaptive SDK, some quick examples, and some discussion of the primary classes. 

### Installation
Getting started is easy. Just install the library using [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/).

##### Installing Podfile
```ruby
pod 'Kidaptive', :git => 'git@github.com:Kidapt/kidaptive-sdk-ios.git', :tag => '1.1.1'
```
### Using the Kidaptive SDK

##### Importing Kidaptive Library

``` objective-c
#import <Kidaptive.h>
```
### Authenticate User

When the session starts up, if it's not already authenticated, you'll need to authenticate the user using the following method. 
``` objective-c
[[Kidaptive alloc] initWithUsername:username password:password delegate:self];
```
**_Parameters_**

- username (NSString): User email address
- password (NSString): User password
- delegate (KidaptiveDelegate): The delegating object KidaptiveDelegate 

**_Response_**

KidaptiveDelegate will implement the following responses:
- kidaptiveDidNotLogin : sdk is unable to login using the username and password
``` objective-c
- (void)kidaptDidNotLogin:(Kidaptive*) kidaptive withError:(NSError*)error;
```
- kidaptiveDidLogin : sdk was able to login successfully, Kidaptive instance is returned
``` objective-c
-(void)kidaptiveDidLogin:(Kidaptive *)kidaptive;
```
- kidaptiveDidLogout : sdk has logged out
``` objective-c
-(void)kidaptiveDidLogout;
```

### Create User
You can create a new kidaptive user. 
``` objective-c
